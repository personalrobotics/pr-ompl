# pr-ompl

A collection of planner implementations for the
[Open Motion Planning Library][ompl] written by the
[Personal Robotics Lab][pr].

Currently, this consists of:

* A variant of the RRTConnect planner that
supports both the EXTEND and CONNECT extension types for each tree (rooted
at the start(s) and goal(s)), which was written by Chris Dellin
(<cdellin@gmail.com>). There are also corresponding [OpenRAVE][openrave] 
bindings.

* An implementation of the NNF (Nearest-Neighbor Fr√©chet) motion planner,
which is used to follow end-effector paths (particularly in 
highly-constrained environments). Please see [this][nnf_paper] paper for more info.

Note that each planner is treated as a separate Catkin package. Additional planners 
will be added in the future following this convention.
