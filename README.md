# pr-ompl

A collection of planner implementations for the
[Open Motion Planning Library][ompl] written by the
[Personal Robotics Lab][pr].

Currently, this consists of LRAstar which encapsulates both [LWA*][LWAstar] and [LazySP][lazySP].

Once these planners are well-tested, we intend to submit them upstream.

#### Note: This requires considerable restructuring to cleanly accomodate different planners.
