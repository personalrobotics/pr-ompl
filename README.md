# pr-ompl

A collection of planner implementations for the
[Open Motion Planning Library][ompl] written by the
[Personal Robotics Lab][pr].

Currently, this consists of LRAstar which encapsulates both LWAstar[Likachev et.al.] and LazySP[Dellin et.al.].

Once these planners are well-tested, we intend to submit them upstream.
